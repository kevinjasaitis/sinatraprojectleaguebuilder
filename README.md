# sinatraprojectleaguebuilder
Had to work through 2 weeks of Covid while going through phase 2, but i feel i perservered and created something I'm actually proud of!

# What this Project Does
This Project as of now helps users show off their favorite builds on any champs they play on league of legends. They can put a description under the image to explain how the build is effective, and they can even put a price tag on it for other people to buy!(buy meaning buying explanations of the build, value they can't get just from copying)

# What i Learned
Tons of trial and error, but I feel this project really enabled me to obtain a strong grasp on sinatra, mvc, active record, sql, etc!
